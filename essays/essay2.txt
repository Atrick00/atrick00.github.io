# Intro
            Video games and slot machines stand among the most addictive creations in the digital world. They both trigger a state of flow that remains unrivaled by most other digital experiences. Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok are edging closer each day but still lag behind the deeply ingrained addictiveness of video games and slot machines. In fact, slot machine addicts have the highest rate of suicide attempts across all forms of addiction, with nearly 20% attempting suicide (Zangeneh and Hason 2006, 191-93).
# As Natasha Dow Schüll, author of *Addicted by Design*, described:
"There was a woman who suffered from severe narcolepsy. She said, ‘I fall asleep driving, during sex, but the only place I don’t fall asleep is playing video poker.' We often imagine casinos with high-stakes games like blackjack, but the real money makers are the slot machines—essentially arcade games for adults that pull people in. Something about these machines holds your attention in a way that can literally keep a severe narcoleptic awake. Something is going on there."
Schüll spent over 15 years studying slot machines in Las Vegas and uncovered startling insights. In her interview on the *Your Undivided Attention* podcast, she recalls:
           "Some listeners might think stories about gamblers wearing diapers are exaggerated, but I’ve interviewed seemingly rational people who admitted to it. They would say, ‘I’ve never done anything like this before, and I’m ashamed, but I wear adult diapers just so I don’t have to leave the machine.’ One casino worker even mentioned that every night, certain machines would be soiled and sent out for cleaning because people wouldn’t leave to use the restroom. The intensity and frequency of the ‘loops’—playing a hand, a spin, or a round—can keep players so engrossed that they lose control. Some machines process 1,200 hands per hour, and at that speed, it’s not just that you’re choosing to continue, it feels like your body is simply unable to stop.”


# How Infinite Scroll Mirrors Slot Machine Addiction
# An Infinite Experience
            Just as slot machines and video games offer endless gameplay, the infinite scroll feature on many apps presents an unending stream of content. Think about the games you’ve played—whether you’re driving, running, or building, the worlds often stretch on forever, allowing you to continue as long as you wish. </p>
Infinite scroll replicates this experience on websites and apps today. You can scroll endlessly without ever reaching the bottom. Each piece of content leads to another, perpetuating a cycle where the end never comes. Even if you tire of one section or piece of content, switching to another just introduces more of the same. This endless experience parallels modern video games, which aim to pull users into a state of flow, enticing them to continue indefinitely.


# Neural Stimulation: A Pinball Machine for the Brain
            The rapid succession of diverse content on infinite scroll platforms lights up the brain similarly to how a pinball machine bounces between circuits. For example, one moment you might be watching a heartwarming video of a baby and a cat, which activates the pleasant, nurturing parts of your brain. The next moment, you’re seeing a video of someone falling off a bike, triggering worry or anxiety. Seconds later, you’re scrolling past a luxury yacht party, then a meme about war. This constant barrage of contrasting stimuli causes different emotional centers in the brain to fire rapidly, leading to addiction, mental fatigue, and disorientation.


# Nano-Anxiety and Dopamine Triggers
            In slot machines, there’s a brief moment of uncertainty—the nano-anxiety—while you wait to see if you’ve hit the jackpot. Dopamine, the "anticipation molecule," floods the brain during this period, making the experience addictively thrilling. Similarly, infinite scroll creates this same effect. As you scroll, your brain never knows what emotional reaction the next piece of content will evoke. Each new video or post could trigger joy, anger, sadness, excitement, or anything in between. This constant state of emotional anticipation hooks the brain, even though the overstimulation can lead to burnout later.


# Bright, Over-Saturated Visuals
            As I’ve discussed before, platforms present content with an explosion of vivid, overly saturated colors—similar to the flashing lights of a pinball machine. Each piece of content is designed to grab your attention with striking visuals, further fueling the addictive nature of scrolling.


# Slot Machine-Like Rewards and Timing
            Like in the famous Skinner box experiment, where rats are driven mad by unpredictable rewards, infinite scroll apps offer unpredictable positive reinforcements. You never know when a notification will pop up, or when the next post will elicit a laugh or a feeling of satisfaction. This irregular reward system keeps users hooked, just like a slot machine, waiting for the next dopamine hit.


# Endless Novelty and Infinite Combinations
            While a traditional three-reel slot machine might offer 216 combinations, the infinite scroll has no such limits. The sheer variety of content—endless reels of new topics, creative visuals, music, animations—makes it the grandest slot machine ever built.


# Ambient Music Enhances the Experience
Every piece of content on social platforms is often paired with music, adding to its addictive nature. Music alone is stimulating, but when paired with visual content, it becomes an even more potent force. Over time, music has become shorter, louder, and more manipulated, perfectly designed to keep you in a hypnotic state while you scroll. Audio engineers have even fine-tuned soundscapes to enhance the experience. For example, some slot machine developers have used anti-noise technology to reduce fatigue and maximize the time players spend on machines.


# Hyper-Stimulation in Comfort
            This intense stimulation happens while you’re sitting or lying down in complete comfort, often isolated from the people around you. Similar to casinos, where machines are designed to keep players physically comfortable, smartphones allow users to lounge on a couch or bed with snacks and no need to move. It’s a level of comfort that casinos could only dream of providing. With the combination of hyper-stimulation and physical comfort, it’s easy to see how a few minutes of scrolling can turn into hours.


# Conclusion
It’s no surprise that developers and designers are leveraging the same psychological tactics that make slot machines so addictive. While it’s unlikely that all of these mechanisms are consciously designed to exploit users, it’s hard to deny that many of the same principles are being employed—whether developers realize the full extent of their impact or not.
