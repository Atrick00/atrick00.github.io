    Grant me just one more ounce of strength, I won't run from the bad stuff, starting tomorrow I'll look everyone in the face, starting tomorrow I'll listen to everyones voices, 
    starting tomorrow I'll do things right, and if I'm not even allowed to have that tomorrow, take me instead, that's probably today.
