            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>As a high schooler navigating the complexities of modern life, I find myself at a crossroads—a place where the expectations of my generation and the realities of our digital existence intersect in ways that are both overwhelming and unsettling. Being </p>
            <p>part of Western Gen-Z, society expects us to live a life steeped in digital interaction—sharing every moment on Instagram, getting news from YouTube, entertaining ourselves on TikTok, buying everything from Amazon, and sinking countless hours </p>
            <p>into the latest video games. You get the point; it's how most of us live. Yet, how often do we stop to think about the consequences of such a lifestyle? Rarely, if ever. And it's not just a personal choice; it's an expectation, a societal norm reinforced by </p>
            <p>the fact that everyone around us, from friends to family, is digitally connected. We are expected to do the same, and the pressure to conform can be suffocating. </p>
